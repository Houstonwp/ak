# ak — Actuarial Kit

`ak` (short for **Actuarial Kit**) is a comprehensive Rust library for actuarial and financial modeling of insurance and reinsurance portfolios.

## Focus

- **Correctness first**: the library is built with a strong emphasis on mathematical accuracy and reproducibility.
- **Performance**: the project targets high performance for large-scale models and simulations.

## Engineering Practices

- **TDD-driven development**: tests guide design and ensure correctness.
- **Benchmarking**: performance is continuously measured and validated.
- **Low-level optimization**: careful memory layout, SIMD utilization, and parallelization are used where they matter most.
